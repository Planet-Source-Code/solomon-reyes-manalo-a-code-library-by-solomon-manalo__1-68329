	Hello!, this is my first submission on PLANET-SOURCE-CODE. This application entitled "SOLO CODE Library"
is intended to help programmers and the like to manage their codes perfectly. 

This software, unlike any other "code library" found on Planet-source-code. has these features:

	1. Security
	2. File and folder Creation

             *Once you create a code file and saves it, it will not be saved in microsoft access database or XML
              but instead it creates its own file with an extension of ".code"

	3. Friendly Interface
	4. etc.


	For any comments or suggestion please email me at solo_sevensix@yahoo.com 
        or visit me at http://www.solosoftware.co.nr
